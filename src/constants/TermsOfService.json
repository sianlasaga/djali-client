  "content": "The Djali community of developers has worked hard to deliver a free market for services. But as with any software, there will be bugs. Djali users may also encounter trolls, spammers, thieves, and other bad actors while using the app. Djali developers will continuously work to provide tools to users that will help them identify, block, and remove bad actors from the Djali ecosystem. However, these tools may fail at times. The developers are not responsible for any monetary loss associated with the software.\n\n Due to the global, peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant nature of Djali, users may see listings for services that are not currently legal in their jurisdiction. It is the responsibility of Djali users to ensure that they are in compliance with the laws of their jurisdiction.\n\nDjali operates over the Tor network by default, and the only information users are required to provide is a handle and country. Djali developers have also made a good faith effort to help users maintain their privacy while using Djali. However, Djali is experimental software, and there may be flaws that reveal sensitive information. It's also easy to de-anonymize oneself, such as by talking about one's personal life with a client, or describing oneself in too much detail. There are also many adversaries--such as governments or criminals--who work to defeat Djali's privacy mechanisms. Therefore, Djali developers do not make any guarantees regarding the ability of the software to maintain user privacy."
